2017.09 - version 0.14.0-preview

ALL
* Added configuration file for Rubocop and auto-resolved coding style issue.

BLOB
* The `Azure::Storage::Blob::list_page_blob_ranges` API now accepts `:previous_snapshot` as an optional parameter, that specifies that the response returns pages that have been updated or cleared since the snapshot specified by `:previous_snapshot` was taken.
* The `Azure::Storage::Blob::Blob` object now has an attribute `:encrypted` showing if the blob or blob related request has been encrypted.
* The `Azure::Storage::Blob::BlobService::list_containers` and `Azure::Storage::Blob::BlobService::get_container_properties` will now also return public access level for each container.
* The stored Content-MD5 property is now returned when requesting a range of a blob. Previously this was only returned for full blob downloads. `Azure::Storage::Blob::Blob.properties[:content_md5]` will always hold the stored Content_MD5 property, and `Azure::Storage::Blob::Blob.properties[:range_md5]` will always represent the MD5 for the content returned from the server.
* Added an API `Azure::Storage::Blob::BlobService::incremental_copy_blob` to support [incremental copy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/incremental-copy-blob) for page blob snapshots.

FILE
* The stored Content-MD5 property is now returned when requesting a range of a file. Previously this was only returned for full file downloads. `Azure::Storage::File::File.properties[:content_md5]` will always hold the stored Content_MD5 property, and `Azure::Storage::File::File.properties[:range_md5]` will always represent the MD5 for the content returned from the server.

QUEUE
* The return type of `Azure::Storage::Queue::create_message` is changed from `nil` to an `Azure::Storage::Queue::Message` object.

FILE
* The API `Azure::Storage::File::list_directories_and_files` now also accepts `:prefix` as an optional parameter. The return value will be filtered with the specified prefix if set.

BLOB
* Block size can now be up to 100MB.

TABLE

* The `Azure::Storage::Table::Entity` does not contain `:table` and `updated` anymore. The updated time can be found in `:properties`.
